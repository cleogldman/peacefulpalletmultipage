            <h12 class="Sarah Description"> Creating my collage as a form of art therapy was more than just arranging images and colors; it became a journey of self-discovery and healing. Each cutout, each placement, spoke volumes about my emotions and experiences. The process allowed me to externalize my inner world, piece by piece, until I could see a reflection of my journey right in front of me. </h12>

            <h15 class="Meghan Description"> Creating that simple doodle was a turning point for me. In the midst of chaos, it became my sanctuary. The strokes of my pen became whispers of calm, and the colors I chose expressed emotions I couldn't articulate. That little doodle was more than art; it was my anchor, a tiny masterpiece that helped me navigate through turbulent waters. It's amazing how something so seemingly small could carry the weight of my emotions and lead me towards tranquility.</h15>

            <h18 class="Jackson Description"> Creating my art journal has been a transformative journey. Through each stroke of color and every penned emotion, this personal visual diary became my sanctuary. It guided me through moments of uncertainty, serving as a compass for my thoughts and feelings. It's where I found solace, expressing what words couldn't convey. My art journal became a cherished confidant, a safe space that allowed me to explore, heal, and embrace my inner world.</h18>
